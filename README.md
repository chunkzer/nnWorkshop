[Slides] (https://slides.com/chunkzer/deck)

# If you don't have Python:
### For OSx users:
* ```$ brew install python 2.7```

### For Linux
* ```$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes```
* ```$ sudo apt-get update```
* ```$ sudo apt-get install python2.7```


# If you don't have pip:

* ```$ sudo easy_install pip```
* ```$ sudo easy_install --upgrade six```
